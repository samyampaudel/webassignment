		As we are student of computing of Nami college, Web development is a major subject we should be studing in our first semester. The subject basically focuses on the development of websites. Firstly we are learned to code from the html. The best application for html programming we got is Sublime Text. We eventually learned to make a basic webpage using html.Due to the tough conditions of COVID we were studing online classes which were quiet difficult to do codes. Our teacher Mr Ankit Thapa never gave us a chance to complain about it.
		when i begin to do my own codes it was little difficult to remember the tags and many more things that were maanadatory for the code to execute. While coding due to a small mistake for eg. forget to put a "" the code was intruuupted and was not working it was the most frustating moment while doing the code.
		  I have faced many ups and downs during the process of thiis assignment. One of the main problem while completin this task was the use of Github. On mac os Git hub application git bash was not working so for the alternate i was using terminal form the macos. It would have been easier enough it i was using this on windows but it was MacOs. The git hub commands were also not working there on terminal. Finlly i got a cheatshit of github commands it helped me alot for pushing of my codes on github. Finally I pushed my codes on git hub succesfully. The one problem when the use of github was being tought our teacher was teachin it orally and we were supposed to do it on our computer it was the most dissapointing part from our teacher also. He sould have done the clas on labs and shown us the working process of the commands. It would have been more easier to use the git hub it we had learned it on lab on my openion.
